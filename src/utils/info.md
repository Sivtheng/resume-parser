The re module in Python is a built-in module that provides regular expression matching operations. "re" stands for "regular expression". Regular expressions are a powerful tool for pattern matching and manipulating strings.

The re module provides various functions and methods to work with regular expressions, including pattern matching, search, substitution, splitting strings, and more. Here are some commonly used functions and methods from the re module:

- re.match(pattern, string): Attempts to match the pattern at the beginning of the string.
- re.search(pattern, string): Searches the string for a match to the pattern, returning a match object if found.
- re.findall(pattern, string): Returns all non-overlapping matches of the pattern in the string as a list of strings.
- re.sub(pattern, repl, string): Replaces occurrences of the pattern in the string with the replacement string (repl).
- re.split(pattern, string): Splits the string by the occurrences of the pattern, returning a list of substrings.
