# Resume Parser

This repository contains code for building a simple resume parser using Python and its libraries. The resume parser is trained to categorize resumes into different job categories based on the provided dataset.

User can update the 'resume.text' variable in the 'predict.py' script. The script will predict the job category it belongs to.

However, this model only has an accuracy evaluation of around 0.60 so it is abit better than guessing (T_T). There are many ways to improve the evaluation but we do not have time to improve or change anything so this is out submission for the project.
